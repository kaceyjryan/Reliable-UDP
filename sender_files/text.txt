began in September 2005 when Munroe decided to scan doodles from his school notebooks and put them on his webpage. Eventually the comic was changed into a stand-alone website, where Munroe started selling T-shirts based on the comic. He currently "works on the comic full-time,"[‡ 1] making Munroe one of the few[8] professional webcomic artists. According to Munroe, the comic's name has no particular significance and is simply a four-letter word without a phonetic pronunciation, something he describes as "a treasured and carefully guarded point in the space of four-character strings." The name of the comic is spelled in all lowercase letters, or all capitals.[‡ 1]
In May 2007, the comic garnered widespread attention by depicting online communities in geographic form.[9] Various websites were drawn as continents, each sized according to their relative popularity and located according to their general subject matter.[9] This put xkcd at number two on the Syracuse Post-Standard's "The new hotness" list.[10]
In October 2008, The New Yorker magazine online published an interview and "Cartoon Off" between Randall Munroe and Farley Katz. For the "Cartoon-Off", Katz and Munroe each drew: "the Internet, as envisioned by the elderly", "String Theory", "1999", and "your favorite animal eating your favorite food".[11]
In March 2010, a puzzle hidden inside of the collection xkcd: Volume 0 was cracked by many members of the xkcd forums. The solution was "<3<3<3 2010-06-26 14:28:57 37.769573°N 122.483123°W."[‡ 4] The first six characters were ASCII art hearts, followed by a date, time, and coordinates. (June 26, 2010, 2:28:57 pm at Golden Gate Park, specifically at the coordinates specified by Google Earth if one searches for Golden Gate Park.[citation needed]) At the appropriate time and date, Munroe again met with fans and handed out 255 limited edition prints of xkcd: Volume 0, titled xkcd: Volume 0 Service Pack 1.[‡ 5]
For April Fools Day 2012, Comic no. 1037 ("Umwelt") displayed different comics depending on browser, location, and IP address range.[‡ 6][‡ 7]
On September 19, 2012, Comic no. 1110 ("Click and Drag"), featured a panel which can be explored via clicking and dragging its insides.[‡ 8] It immediately triggered positive response on social websites and forums.[12] The large image measures 165,888 pixels wide by 79,822 pixels high.[13]
Comic number 1190 ("Time") began publication at midnight EDT on March 25, 2013, with the comic's image updating every 30 minutes until March 30, when they began to change every hour, lasting for over four months. The images constitute time lapse frames of a story, with the mouseover text originally reading "Wait for it.", later changed "RUN." and changed again to "The end." on July 26. The story began with a male and female character building a sandcastle complex on a beach who then embark on an adventure to learn the secrets of the sea. On July 26, the comic superimposed a frame (3094) with the phrase "The End". Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club wrote of the comic: "[...] the kind of nifty experiment that keeps people coming back to XKCD, which at its best isn't a strip comic so much as an idea factory and a shared experience".[14] Cory Doctorow mentioned "Time" in a brief article on Boing Boing on April 7, saying the comic was "coming along nicely". The 3,099-panel "Time" comic ended on July 26, 2013 and the "secret" backstory has now been revealed.[15]
For April Fools Day 2013, Comic no. 1193 ("Externalities") changed its text content over that day, depending on various external values, from the amount of money donated to the Wikimedia Foundation via a link in the comic, to the school of first- and third-place winners of an XKCD hash-finding competition at http://almamater.xkcd.com/.
